Django can be used as-is to develop full stack web apps which include your frontend and backend. This however isn't the focus of this guide.

You will be using Django alongside Django REST Framework to instead build a backend API, which will only serve data from your database, and not serve as a frontend framework. This guide will focus on data, so no fancy frontend design stuff!

This guide has concepts that are similar to the official guide for Django linked [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/tutorial01/). Check it out as well!
