Starting October 14, All URLs from my [Bookstack](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack) [instance](https://bookstack.06222001.xyz/) from blogs and guides will redirect [here](https://resources.06222001.xyz/). I will be archiving the legacy site and will now mainly be using this [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) instance. 

You can still find the exact blog posts, guides, and bookmarks in the [Docs](https://resources.06222001.xyz/docs) section, kept up to date on whatever shenanigans I come across.

The export function to `.pdf` and `.md` files from [Bookstack](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack) will no longer be available. In its place are [GitHub](https://github.com/lemeow125/Notes) and [Gitea](https://git.06222001.xyz/keannu125/Notes) repositories which you can use to download the site in its entirety or a select few resources such as the guides. 

You can use VSCode or similar applications to preview any of the markdown (`.md`) files if you wish to have your own copy. I suggest using Yiyi Wang's [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) extension if you're using VSCode.

For anything else, feel free to reach out. Cheers everyone!
